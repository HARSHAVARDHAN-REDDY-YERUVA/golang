# 1. Write a program that 
#     assigns an int to a variable
#     prints that int in decimal, binary, and hex
#     shifts the bits of that int over 1 position to the left, and assigns that to a variable
#     prints that variable in decimal, binary, and hex

package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	
	a := 2
	fmt.Printf("%d\t%b\t%#x\n", a, a, a)
	
	b := a << 1
	fmt.Printf("%d\t%b\t%#x", b, b, b)
}

Output:
2	10	0x2
4	100	0x4
