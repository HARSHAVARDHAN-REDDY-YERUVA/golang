# 1. create a type person struct
# 2. attach a method speak to type person using a pointer receiver
#     *person
# 3. create a type human interface
#     to implicitly implement the interface, a human must have the speak method
# 4. create func “saySomething” 
#     have it take in a human as a parameter
#     have it call the speak method
# 5. show the following in your code 
#     you CAN pass a value of type *person into saySomething
#     you CANNOT pass a value of type person into saySomething

package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type person struct {
	first string
	last  string
}

func (p *person) speak() {
	fmt.Println("speaking")
}

type human interface {
	speak()
}

func saySomething(h human) {
	h.speak()
}

func main() {
	p := person{
		first: "Harsha",
		last:  "Yeruva",
	}
	saySomething(&p)
	//saySomething(p)
}

Output:

speaking
